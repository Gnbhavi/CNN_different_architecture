# CNN_different_architecture


To learn the basics of CNN architecture we are going to create notebooks of different architecture.
Here, we are going to use pytorch to create these network and analyse those hting in notebooks.

## The network used here are:
- Inception (GoogleNet)
- ResNet (Mix of Google Net and ResNet also)
- U-Net
